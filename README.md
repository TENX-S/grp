# Random key generator


**USE AS YOUR OWN RISK**

## What

Generate random keys in handy way. 


## Why
	
To learn Rust.


## Requirement
	
Rust 1.39 or higher.


## Try it
	
```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/TENX-S/rand_key
$ cd rand_key

# Default case: amount of letters: 10, symbols: 2, numbers: 3
$ cargo run --release --example kg_test

# Specify the parameter: amount of letters: 16, symbols: 2, numbers: 3
$ cargo run --release --example kg_test 16 2 3

# Try a larger number!
$ cargo run --release --example kg_test 200000 200 300

# Larger and set the unit value
$ cargo run --release --example kg_test 100000000 0 0 100000
```


## Usage

In `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
rand_pwd = "1" # Deprecated
```

The latest version:
```toml
rand_key = { git = "https://github.com/TENX-S/rand_key", branch = "master" }
```

Here's a simple demo:
```rust
use rand_key::{RandKey, ToRandKey};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {

    let r_p = RandKey::new("10", "2", "3")?; // For now, it's empty. Use method `join` to generate the key
    r_p.join()?;                                 // Now `r_p` has some content, be kept in its `key` field
    println!("{}", r_p);                         // Print it on the screen
    // One possible output: 7$pA7yMCw=2DPGN

    // You can also use the method `to_randkey` to convert a `String` or `&str` to `RandPwd`
    let r_p = "n4jpstv$dI,.z'K".to_randkey()?;
    // You can re-generate a random key and with equivalent amount of letters, symbols and numbers. Like below:
    r_p.join()?;
    println!("{}", r_p);
    // One possible output: qS`Xlyhpmg~"V8[
    // But you have to make sure that they were composed of ASCII characters or it will return `Err`.
    assert!("🦀️🦀️🦀️".to_randkey().is_err());
    Ok(())
}
```
